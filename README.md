<h1>Database Connectors</h1>

<h3>I created this repo to showcase the differences between newer, non-relational DB technology and standard MySQL technolgy, along with the scripts to get up and running.</h3>

<h2> Which DB tech is most likely to disrupt the industry?</h2>  

Not all of them are going to find their place in this new world of AI and ML. But more and more of them are beginning to serve a specific purpose, like Redis and MondoDB for IoT, sensors or edge devices, even live streaming data.

Often times, databases fit a particular instance or concept and may be migrated when the business pivots or changes something fundamental about their data storage.


<b>Some topics to explore:</b>

<li>Redis Cache and what it uses to make database speed/transaction-efficency that surpass the rest. (IoT, edge devices, Content delivery networks)
<li>MongoDB documents, collections, steaming real-time data. (real-time visualizations and streaming, IoT, edge devices, automation) 
<li></lio>SQLite for handling large amounts of string data. (maybe best for blogs and article writing)

<li>Name a few different businesses across different industries and contemplate which database technology may be used for a specific purpose. </li>


<em>This repo is a work in progress. The end goal is many db connector scripts for many DB technologies in many different languages.</em>
