#This repo provides a demonstration on how to connect to the MongoDB database server and create a table. 

<p>it stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON. This allows for dynamic schemas, 
  meaning documents in the same collection can have different structures. MongoDB is widely used for its scalability, 
  high performance, and ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data.

<h3>This repo will demonstrate how to:</h3>

  1. Connect to your database using Golang.


  2. Create a table.


  3. Insert a record


  Document (MongoDB) : In MongoDB, data is stored in documents, which are JSON-like structures. Here’s how the terminology compares to relational databases:
  
  Record (Relational Database) ~ A document is an individual data entry stored in a collection, similar to a row in a table.
  
  Field (MongoDB) ≈ Column (Relational Database)
        A field is a key-value pair inside a document, similar to a column in a row.
